        <h3>My name is Motunrayo Sholola</h3>
        <p>
            My love for technology started in 2010 during my NYSC. 
             There was a particular guy who was so good at programming that he usually designed beautiful web pages
             for fellowships, churches, and schools. Every time I saw his designs, I was inspired to become a developer 
             but was unable to do so due to a lack of funding. Ever since then, I have been determined to become a developer
             if I ever have the opportunity.<b>I aspire to be a full-stack developer in the future.</b> 
             I am passionate about solving problems using technology, and this passion makes me want to 
             learn so many things about technology. I was a complete novice prior to October 2022, but with Stutern,
             I have learned a lot about software engineering in the last two months.
             By the end of this program, I hope to be a skilled backend developer.
             <b>I envision myself as a skilled backend developer by the end of this programme.</b>

            I learnt the fundamental principles of HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) as a web lagauage that determine
            how the browser display tet and images on a webpage. Tags are used to indicate the various elements and 
            also determine how the position of the paragraphs, headings, images and videos on a webpages.

            I learnt the fundamental basic concepts of CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is the web Language that is use for styling an HTML document. 
            CSS is used to specify how HTML elements should be displayed. CSS help to beautify a webpage
            <b>There three major ways in which CSS can be use to style HTML.</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Inline CSS styling:</b> this contains the CSS property in the body section that is attached to an element</li>
            <li><b>Internal or embedded CSS styling:</b> this can ce used to stuyle single html document in a unque way, it is embedded in the head section</li>
            <li><b>External CSS styling:</b> is a CSS file that is use by creating a link with the heade dection of a website, can be use to change the design of the entire website with just a file. 
            External style sheets are created in a separate document and tagged with CSS </li>
        </ul>

        <p>I learnt the importance of <b>specificity.</b> specificity help the broswer to determine the specific 
            property to be attributed to an element.
        </p>
        <p>I also learnt about the various <b>CSS selectors.</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Element selector: it help to select one or more of a particula HTML elemnt.</li>
            <li>Class selector: this target all the elements that a particular class name.</li>
            <li>ID selector:This work similarly to class selector.</li>
            <li>Universal selector: this is a unique selector that is useful when dealing with document that contain lots of namespaces.</li> 
            <li>Attribute selector: this is use to style elements that have specific attribute and value.</li>
        </ol>

            <b>Padding</b>
